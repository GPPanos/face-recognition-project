# Face Detection Project

This simple Python project utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection using a webcam. The script captures video input, converts it to grayscale, and applies a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)

## Installation
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. Download the Haar Cascade classifier XML file (`haarcascade_frontface_default.xml`) from the OpenCV GitHub repository or other reliable sources.

3. Place the XML file in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python face_detection.py
```

The script will activate your webcam, and you'll see a live video feed with green rectangles around detected faces. Press 'a' key to exit the program.

## Parameters
Adjust the parameters in the script to customize the face detection:
- `scaleFactor`: Controls the image scale reduction during the face detection process.
- `minNeighbors`: Specifies the number of neighbors a candidate rectangle should have to retain it.
- `minSize`: Sets the minimum object size to be considered.
- `flags`: Specifies the operation mode for the face detection.

Feel free to experiment with these parameters to achieve optimal face detection results.
